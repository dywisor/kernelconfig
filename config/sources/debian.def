# This is the definition file of the "Debian" source.
#
# Currently, it is very restrictive on the supported archs
# and overly permissive on arch flavour and the featureset.
#
# Archs should can be enabled by adding them to "Arch =".
# If a rename is required, an "[Arch:<match>]" section
# with "Value=<rename>" should be added, see x86_64 for an example.
